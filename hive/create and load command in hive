A. create database
------------------
create database retail;

--this creates a folder by the name of retail.db under /user/hive/warehouse

A1. show all the databases in hive
----------------------------------
show databases;

B. Select a database
--------------------
use retail;

B1. Show tables under the database
----------------------------------
show tables;


C1. Create transaction table
-------------------------------
create table txnrecords(txnno INT, txndate STRING, custno INT, amount DOUBLE, 
category STRING, product STRING, city STRING, state STRING, spendby STRING)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ','
stored as textfile;

C2. Create customer table
-------------------------------
create table customer(custno INT, firstname STRING, lastname STRING, age INT, profession STRING)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ','
stored as textfile;

nyse table
--------------------------------
create table NYSE(exchange_name STRING,stock_id STRING,stock_date DATE,open DOUBLE,high DOUBLE,low DOUBLE,close DOUBLE,volume BIGINT,adj_close DOUBLE) 
row format delimited
fields terminated by ','
stored as textfile;

D1. Load the data into the table (from local file system)
-----------------------------------------------------
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/hduser/txns1.txt' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE txnrecords; // will delete old data and add new data

LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/hduser/custs' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE customer;

LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/hduser/custs_add' INTO TABLE customer;

LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/hduser/NYSE.csv' INTO TABLE NYSE;

load- transfer from local to hdfs
to save the file on hdfs
if there are many file then overwrite 1st file only .. not others..
load and put does same work.. but load doesnt need perfect file
-------------------------
INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/niit/custcount' row format delimited fields terminated by ',' 
select profession, count(*) from customer group by profession;

INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/niit/custcount' row format delimited fields terminated by ',' 
select profession, count(*) from customer group by profession;
----
INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/niit/nyse_example' row format delimited fields terminated by ',' 
select count(*) from nyse;

INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/niit/nyse_totalstock' row format delimited fields terminated by ',' 
select stockid,sum(volume) as total_vol from nyse group by stock_id order by total_vol desc;

INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/niit/nyse_totalstock' row format delimited fields terminated by ',' 
select stock_id,(((high-low)*100)/low) as variance from nyse group by stock_id order by variance desc limit 5;

tp 5 max variances and save as csv file  
INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/niit/nyse_totalstock' row format delimited fields terminated by ',' 
select stock_id,max(((high-low)*100)/low) as variance from nyse group by stock_id order by variance desc limit 5;


float percentChange = ((highVal - lowVal) * 100) / lowVal;
// high  variance is risky

N1. how do i know i am in which database currently// permant in site.xml
--------------------------------------------------
